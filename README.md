Game Composer with over one year experience at one of the game studios in Indonesia. Using FL Studio, MuseScore, and VST, I created soundtracks, music levels, cut scenes, and sound effects for four games developed in the studio. The music which I produced for the team inside the studio became the 1st game prototype winner at Agate Academy that collaborate with Kampus Merdeka. In the national game hackathon, a game from the studio became the 2nd winner. The last is in Indigo Startup Incubation. The music for As I Began To Dream became the selected game for <a href="https://id.techinasia.com/startup-game-lolos-inkubator-igsi">Alpha Incubation</a>. Besides making game music, I enjoyed composing instrumental music with the strings element and making transcriptions from the songs.
